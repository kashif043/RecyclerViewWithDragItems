# RecyclerViewWithDragItems
User can drag items of recycler list view and drop them into the folder into the list if he wants to manage the list items accordingly. User can create folder by clicking the add folder button and then he can just drag and drop files in the list to manage the content.
I am using Images as recycler view items and user can drag images to any folder and the images will move to that folder.
